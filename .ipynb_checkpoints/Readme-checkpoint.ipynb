    "In this study, we will be analyzing CNN-Daily Mail News Articles. Many companies want to keep track of the latest news trends and reading full length articles can be incredibly time consuming. With the way news headlines affect major business decisions such as legal matters and stock prices, its important that readers are able to obtain all the information and reasoning behind the purpose of these articles and many of them can have a large number of distractors. It's essential that companies that get this information have the ability to quickly analyze these articles and develop counter intel or reports of their own in order to stay current and relevant with today's media. In this study we take the first steps towards utilizing text summarization to fast track the information gathering and counter-reporting process. \n"

    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's information age, staying updated with news and information is crucial for both individuals and businesses. However, the sheer volume of news articles published daily can be overwhelming. Reading and processing these articles is time-consuming, especially when trying to gather insights from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we propose the development of a text summarization model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This model will automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of news articles. Here's how it can benefit the public and support business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Time Efficiency`: People often struggle to find the time to read lengthy news articles. Automated summarization allows individuals to quickly grasp the key points of an article, saving them time while keeping them informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Enhanced Understanding`: Summaries provide a condensed version of the article, making complex topics more accessible to a wider audience. This can help people better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Multi-source Insights`: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to get a well-rounded view of a topic, fostering critical thinking and a broader perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Competitive Intelligence`: Businesses can use automated summarization to track news and developments in their industry, enabling them to stay ahead of competitors and adapt to market changes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Market Research`: Summarization can assist in analyzing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies by summarizing customer reviews, news, and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Content Curation`: Media companies and content aggregators can use summarization to curate content for their audience, improving user engagement and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamline and automate the understanding of complex news topics. \n",
    "2. Help track news developments to enhance market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What specific NLP techniques or models can be employed to automate the process of summarizing complex news articles effectively?\n",
    "- How can automation be leveraged to provide real-time updates on important news developments to users or clients?\n",
    "- Are there opportunities to use automation to personalize news content delivery based on individual user preferences and interests?\n",
    "- How can automated summarization and analysis be integrated into other tools or platforms, such as news aggregators or chatbots?\n",
    "- What are the critical news sources, categories, or keywords that have the most significant impact on market trends and consumer sentiment?\n",

    "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\"\n",

    "### Attention Layer\n",
    "An attention layer is a critical component in modern neural network architectures, particularly in sequence-to-sequence models, and it plays a fundamental role in enhancing the model's ability to focus on specific parts of input data. Here's an explanation of the concept of an attention layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose of Attention: The primary purpose of an attention layer is to enable a neural network to \"pay attention\" to different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. It allows the model to assign varying degrees of importance or relevance to different elements in the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sequences and Alignment: Attention layers are commonly used in tasks involving sequences, such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. When processing sequences, it's important to consider the alignment between the elements of the input and output sequences. The attention mechanism helps in aligning these sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mechanism: The attention mechanism works by computing a weighted sum of the elements in the input sequence, where the weights are dynamically determined based on the context of the current decoding step. In other words, it identifies which parts of the input sequence are most relevant for generating the current output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculation of Attention Weights: Attention weights are calculated by comparing the current state of the model (decoder) to each element in the input sequence. These comparisons are often performed using a similarity function, such as dot product or cosine similarity. The results are then transformed into probabilities using a softmax function, making them sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Performance: Attention mechanisms have significantly improved the performance of sequence-to-sequence models in various NLP tasks.\n",
    "- Handling Variable-Length Sequences: Attention allows the model to handle input sequences of variable length and generate output sequences of varying length.\n",
    "- Improved Interpretability: Attention mechanisms provide insights into which parts of the input data are influential in making specific predictions.\n",

    "A Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is a type of neural network architecture designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text summarization.

In the context of text summarization, it's used to convert long articles or documents into shorter, coherent summaries. \n",
